        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: July 12, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of
            your information when you play <strong>XRunner VR</strong> and tells you about your privacy rights
            and how the law protects you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use your personal data only to operate and improve the game experience. By using XRunner VR,
            you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h1>Interpretation and Definitions</h1>
        <h2>Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
            Words with an initial capital letter have meanings defined under the following conditions. These
            definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or plural.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application</strong> refers to XRunner VR, the software program provided by the Company.</li>
            <li><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either “the Company”, “We”, “Us” or “Our” in this Agreement)
                refers to Giaste FZ.</li>
            <li><strong>Country</strong> refers to United Arab Emirates.</li>
            <li><strong>Device</strong> means any device that can access the Service such as a computer,
                a phone or a VR headset.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
                individual.</li>
            <li><strong>Service</strong> refers to the Application.</li>

        </ul>

        <h1>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h1>

        <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
        <p>
            XRunner VR itself does not directly request or store personal information. The only data we
            access comes from your Meta profile for the purpose of displaying the in-game leaderboard:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your public Meta display name</li>
            <li>Your public Meta profile picture/avatar</li>
            <li>Your Meta account ID (hashed in-memory for ranking logic)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
            The Meta-profile data shown above is used solely to:
        <ul>
            <li>Rank players and display names/avatars on the live leaderboard</li>
            <li>Detect duplicate accounts and maintain fair competition</li>
        </ul>
        <em>No other personal data is collected, and we never use this information for advertising,
            analytics beyond the leaderboard, or any non-gameplay purpose.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
            XRunner VR does <strong>not</strong> persist Meta-profile data to disk or cloud storage. All data is kept
            in volatile memory for the duration of your play session and is permanently discarded when
            you exit the game.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or otherwise transfer any leaderboard or profile information to third
            parties. Rankings are shown only to players inside the game session.
        </p>

        <h1>Security of Your Personal Data</h1>
        <p>
            Even though we do not store personal data long-term, we implement industry-standard
            security measures (encrypted transport, secure sandboxing, least-privilege access) to
            protect the transient data handled during gameplay.
        </p>

        <h1>Children’s Privacy</h1>
        <p>
            Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect
            personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child
            has provided us personal data, please contact us so we can delete it immediately.
        </p>

        <h1>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
            along with an updated “Last updated” date. Material changes will be announced inside the game
            or via a notice on our website before they take effect.
        </p>
